********************************************************************************
A NOTE ON METADATA FORMATS FOR THIS DATA SET:

Metadata is provided both in .html and .xml formats.

* The .html version is provided for viewing.
* The .xml version is a generic format that can be imported into the Minnesota 
Metadata Editor (MME), ESRI’s ArcCatalog metadata management tool or other 
available metadata tools.

The .xml is provided for the convenience of the data user who would 
like to document changes they have made to the original data set.   
(Note:  MnGeo recommends that if you change the data file, you rename it and 
create a new metadata record with the new data set name to avoid confusion 
between the user-revised data set and the original.)

To obtain a free copy of MME or to find other help with metadata, go to
